# zipper
Zipper - Action Adventure Platform game implemented in Kivy  

2D platform game, with a focus on reflex and character agility.

Currently only a very small sandbox environment is present, with some rudimentary movement / collision.  More is on the way.

To test it out : 

- Install Python 2.7
- Install Kivy 
- Clone the repository
- Run main.py

Controls : 

- a,d = move left,right
- spacebar = jump
- x = attack with sword
- left mouse click (and hold) - aim character
- while mouse button held, press 'z' - move until collision with object
- character will stay attached until mouse button is removed.
