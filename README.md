Zipper - Action Adventure Platform game implemented in Kivy 

![Zipper](zippy_screenshot.png?raw=true)

2D platform game, with a focus on reflex and character agility.

Currently only a very small sandbox environment is present, with some rudimentary movement / collision.  More is on the way.

To test it out :

- Install Python 3.11
- Install Kivy 2.2 or newer
- Clone the repository
- Run main.py

Controls : 

- left arrow, right arrow = move left,right
- spacebar = jump
- x = attack with sword
- left mouse click (and hold) - aim character
- mouse button release moves character quickly in the direction of the last touch point
